If i had infinite skills i would build many online video games. 
One online tactical shooter. 
One Roblox game of any genre. 
And one gacha game. 
These tend to be where the money is when it comes to gaming
and if i had the skills to build and maintain them all myself 
and keep all the profits then that would be great
